               <h1>First encounter with CSS</h1>
		<p>Well, I, for the first time tried to create a websiet using HTML and CSS.On the very first day I created the home page with many colors and different fonts and when I finally done with the home page I thougt "if this goes live and any user by chance visits my site will swear to god not to visit it again".</p>
		<p>Then I decided to use minimum number of colors in a proper way. I have googled and thanks to the mentors, I got to know some valuable things and then created a little better home page than earlier.(even this is not that good , but better when compared with my earlier version).</p>
		<p>I should mention about few words I heard like Clean Designing etc.
I realised the clean designing means, designing your website in such a way that it should convey the message to the user in just first few seconds.</p>
		<p>In other word the user should be able to find out what he is lokking for.
As we see in common user point of view , if we are visiting any website for the first time we do not spend much time there if we do not find the desired content immediately.
</p>
		<p>We should mind few things while creating a website like :</p>
		<p><ul><li>What exactly the user want from this website.</li>
			<li>How he expects the information should be.</li>

			</ul></p>

<p>For example, if it is a site regarding Indian tourism, the visitor expects the content should be presented region wise.</p>

<p>
Few more important points which I have learned.</p>

<p><ul><li>In  corporate website there should not be many colors.</li>
			<li>Content should be legible and short and clear. (Here clear means, it sould convey the meaning properly)</li>
<li>The user should be able to find the required information immediently as soon as he enters into the website.</li>
<li>Data should be properly devided into sections.</li>
<li>It would be better not to have more than 2 primary colors.</li>
<li>The color theme also needs to match with the purpose of the site.
For example if the site is all about nature and wild life, then the colour should be red, it would be beter to use green color.</li>
			</ul></p>
